"# NeuralNetworkFrameWork" 

Welcome to my neural network

I made this neural network frame work.
I did not make my own Matrix class the matrix class is from: https://github.com/akalicki/matrix


But I did add new functions: 
-	Map(func) apply function on every item
-	Randomize() randomize every value
-	ToVector() and fromVector() convert matrix from or to Vector



I based my neuralNetwork on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh
